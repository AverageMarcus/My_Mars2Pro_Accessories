; [Speed/Acceleration Setting] The speed is in mm/s and the acceleration is in mm/s^2
M8006 I30; The maximum starting speed, when the movement speed exceeds this speed, the speed will be used as the starting speed.
; This speed is mainly to prevent loss of step, if this value is too small, it will cause the rail angle to bulge when rounding
M8007 I15; The maximum orbit speed value (corresponding to the jerk speed in the open source firmware), if the actual orbit speed of the movement is greater than this value,
; Will force the movement to decelerate. When filling, there will be a lot of reciprocating movement, this value is large, noise is large, and it is easy to lose steps.
; This value is small, the speed is slow, when the printing speed is high, the printing quality will be relatively poor
M8008 I1000; Acceleration, the larger the value, the higher the average speed of actual operation, but the noise is also large, the value is small, the actual speed will be smaller,

M8024 I0; X maximum stroke, the axis is used for demoulding in the X direction or used for scraping. If the direction does not need to move, the stroke is set to zero, and the manual interface cannot operate scraping. If it is set to non-zero, turn it on The axis will return to zero
M8025 I0; Y maximum stroke, this axis is used to block the lens of the projector, the lens is blocked at the reset position, and the lens is not blocked at the maximum stroke position. If the axis movement is not required, set this parameter to 0, manual interface It can’t be operated either. If a non-zero setting is set, the axis will return to zero after power on
M8026 I165; Z maximum stroke, this stroke is the movement stroke of Z, be sure to measure it with a ruler, set it carefully, after the pause and print, the Z axis will stay at the maximum stroke position
