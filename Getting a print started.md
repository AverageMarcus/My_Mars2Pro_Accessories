**Powering on the Printer.**

1.  Check the power adapter, ensure it's firmly plugged into the wall outlet - you should see a blue LED (on the transformer brick) to indicate that it has mains power.

2.  Plug the DC end of the power adapter into the receptacle at the rear of the printer. Check the power switch is in the "ON" position.

3.  The front LCD touch panel should greet you with a graphical display.

**Leveling the build plate, checking the UV light, and readying the resin.**

1.  If the build plate is not at least half-way up, raise it by selecting the 'Tool' Button, 'Manual' Button, '10mm' Button, then Up Bottom. Each time you press this, it will raise only 10mm, so you may have to press this multiple times.

2.  Remove the build plate by turning the top black rotary knob (on the Z-axis) in a counter-clockwise direction, enabling the build plate to be slid towards you. Do not remove the rotary knob; only rotate it enough to slide the plate off.

3.  Ensure the build plate is clean and free of any resin or gunk; gently scrape if needed.

4.  Grab the desired resin, check the recommended printing temperature, and ensure you sliced your model using the correct resin profile. Shake the resin bottle well (vigorously) for about 5 minutes. Wrap the resin bottle and build the plate in a heating pad and warm until it is at the proper temp.

5.  As you are warming the resin bottle and build plate, ensure your sliced model is on the printer's network share drive.

6.  Once warmed and at the proper temp, clean the build plate surface with alcohol and lint-free cloth. Slide the build plate back onto the printer's Z-axis and tighten the rotary knob.

7.  Remove the resin vat and place it on its side, in an area where you won't knock it. Check the top LCD free and clean. If dust or residue is present, remove using a clean microfiber cloth - apply alcohol if needed. !Only use microfiber cloth!

8.  Test the UV light source by selecting the 'Tool' button, 'Exposure' button, adjust for a few seconds and select the 'Next' button to begin. You should see a complete rectangular image on the top LCD; the front touchscreen should display the same.

9.  Get a standard sheet of printer paper, cut it in half, and place it over the top LCD screen.

10.  Loosen the two bright hex-head bolts on the build plate head using the large hex wrench - one is on the front, the other on the side. Do not unscrew completely, just enough to allow the build plate to rotate freely as well as up and down.

11.  Home the Z-axis by selecting the 'Tool' button, 'Manual' button, and Home button (looks like an upside-down T).

12.  The build plate will go down to the paper, slightly rise, and then down again. Check the build plate's alignment and rotate as needed to ensure it is square with the printer. Gently tighten the forward-facing hex-head bolt first, followed by the side facing.

13.  Gently try to pull the paper out, not all the way but just only by a few millimeters or so. If the paper is unable to move, raise the build plate 0.1mm by first selecting the '0.1mm' button, followed by the Up button - this is not always required, only if you feel the paper will tear when pulling.

14.  Select the 'Z=0' button, and select confirm. Raise the build plate by pressing the 10mm button, followed by the up button, at least seven times. Remove the paper.

15.  Grab the resin vat. Check it free and clean - both sides. And again, check the top LCD free and clean. If dust or residue is present, remove using a clean microfiber cloth - apply alcohol if needed. !Only use microfiber cloth!

16.  Gently slide the resin vat into position, taking care to glide it in with a slight upward force against the securing towers and not the LCD screen (the vat film and LCD screen scratch easily). Ensure the vat is in place before screwing in the two-tower side bolts by feeling a small detent position where it sits securely without wobble. The max resin fill indication should be visible from the front, and the resin pour-out groove should be closest to you on the tank's bottom right.

17.  Grab the now warmed resin, shake it gently for an additional minute or so, then slowly and carefully fill the vat to just below the max line.

18.  Let the resin in the vat sit for a few minutes to let any air bubbles escape.

19.  Begin printing your sliced model's CTB file from the front touch screen or the webpage interface.
